- When I tried to modify the Custom domain, I was prompted：
- The CNAME 6s9.cc is already taken. Check out https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#cname-already-taken for more information.
- Would you release it for me?
- My Domain 6s9.cc points to 6cc.github.io，I don't know if this can prove my ownership
- Or you can send me the TXT record verification,Thank you

### GitHub Pages配置域名重复的问题
http://wanghaorui.com/2018/05/10/gitpage开设的问题/
- Today I created a repository (GitHub Pages) with CNAME "wanghaorui.com"
"The CNAME wanghaorui.com is already taken. Check out https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#cname-already-taken for more information."
i am unsure which repository contains the CNAME file with your custom domain,
what should I do now?
