```
Look around yourself can't you see this wonder 
看看你的周围 你看不到这些
Spreading from the view the clouds floating by 
散布在你眼前的奇迹吗 漂浮的云彩
The skies are clear and blue planets in the orbits 
天空那么清澈 湛蓝 行星在轨道上运行
The moon and the sun such perfect harmony 
Let's start question in ourselves isn't this proof enough for us 
试着问问自己 难道这些证据还不够吗
Or are we so blind to push it all aside no 
We just have to open our eyes our hearts our minds 
我们只需要打开我们的眼睛 心里 思想
If we just look bright to see the signs we can't keep hiding from the true 
Let it take us by surprise 
让我们为此惊讶吧
Take us in the best way allah guide us every single day allah 
Keep us close to you until the end of time 
让我们一直接近你 直到时间的尽头
Look inside yourself such a perfect order 
看看你自己内部 如此完美的程序
Hiding in yourself coming in your veins what about anger love and pain 
And all the things you're feeling 
Can you touch them with you hands so are they really there 
Let's start question in ourselves isn't this proof enough for us 
Or are we so blind to push it all aside no 
难道我们故意对之置之不理吗 不
We just have to open our eyes our hearts our minds 
If we just look bright to see the signs we can't keep hiding from the true 
Let it take us by surprise 
Take us in the best way allah guide us every single day allah 
Keep us close to you until the end of time 
让我们一直接近你 直到时间的尽头
When a baby's born so helpless and weak And you're watching him growing 
当一个婴儿诞生 如此脆弱 你看着他成长
So why deny whats in front of your eyes the biggest miracle of life 
We just have to open our eyes our hearts our minds 
If we just look bright to see the signs we can't keep hiding from the true 
如果看清这些征兆 我们无法隐藏这些真相
Let it take us by surprise take us in the best way guide us every single day
