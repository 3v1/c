Thinkin' back in time
有时想想
Someone said that love is blind
有的人说爱情是盲目的
But they were wrong
但他们错了
You just choose to not see
只是当美好的爱情呈现在你眼前时
When it's right before your eyes
你选择了不去面对而已
You'd rather compromise and give it all
你宁可妥协也不放弃一切
Then it don't turn out
结果一切
The way it's supposed to be
都不如所愿
Time and time again, you disappoint
然后你一次又一次在她相信你的时候
When she believes
让她失望
Just do your best
努力做最好的自己就好
And give her what she needs
给予她所需的一切
And cherish her love
并珍惜她对你的爱
Show her she's right
让她知道她是对的
Where she belongs
成为她的归宿
Take care of her heart
细心呵护她那颗心
Before she's gone
在他离开之前
Cherish her love
珍惜她对你的爱
It might be hard to conceive
这或许很难想象
You gotta see the forest
但你得看看
Despite the trees
树林在燃烧殆尽前
Before it all burns down
那华丽转变
Not tellin' ya nothing
并不是再告诉你
You don't know
你不知道的一切
But she'll let you have your fun
但她会让你的生活充满乐趣
But when a woman's done, she's done
担当女人们受够了 厌倦了这一切
And then she'll go
她们就会离开
Just when you're needin' her the most
就挑在你最需要她的时候离开你
Time and time again, you disappoint
在她相信你时 你一次又一次地
When she believes, oh yeah
让她失望 没错
Do all you can
力所能及
To give her what she needs
给予她所需的一切
Cherish her love
并珍惜她对你的爱
Show her she's right
让她知道她是对的
Where she belongs
成为她的归宿
Take care of her heart
细心呵护她那颗心
Before she's gone
在她离开之前
Cherish her love
珍惜她对你的爱
And if you care about the weather
若你感受到天气的变化
Keep her safe and warm
那就确保她安全 给她温暖
Let nothing in between stand in your way
你要风雨无阻
They say it's calm inside
人们不是都说暴风雨的凤眼
The eye of the storm
总是平静的很么
Together come, whatever comes what may
无论面对什么 不管发生什么 都心系一起
Just cherish her love
珍惜她对你的爱
Show her she's right
